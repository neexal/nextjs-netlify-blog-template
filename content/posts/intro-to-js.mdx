JavaScript is a programming language used primarily by web browsers to create a dynamic and interactive experience by the user. It is a lightweight and interpreted language.

JavaScript is a scripting language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages. JavaScript is now everywhere and it's usage has now extended to mobile app development, desktop app development, and game development.



## Writing First program in JavaScript

JavaScript needs to be written inside of <script> tag in a HTML Document. 

```html
<html>
<head>
        <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
        <script>
            alert("Hello World!");
        </script>
</body>
</html>
```

General rules to be followed while writing JavaScript:

* JavaScript is case-sensitive.
* Statements should end in a semicolon (;).
* To enter comments in the script, use "//" to start a single line comment or the combination of /\* and \*/ to enclose a multi-line comment.
* Variables name can contain A – Z, a – z, underscore or digits and must start with a letter or an underscore (“_”).
* JavaScript is a dynamically typed language. The data type does not have to be explicitly defined while creating a variable.
